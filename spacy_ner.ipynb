We will be using spacy (https://spacy.io/) here to \"get our feet wet\" with NER, as training spacy can be reasonably done on our laptops and does not yet necessarily require a GPU. Spacy is a powerful, effective, and resource-efficient NLP library - It might surprise us with its performance on the challenge!\n",

In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk\\nand capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves\\nappropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.\\n\\nThe New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital\\nrequirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage\\n(CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are\\nSimple VaR if the collateral is eligible.

The purpose of Basel II, which was initially published in June 2004, is to\\ncreate an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about\\nhow much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational\\nrisks banks face. In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk\\nand capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves\\nappropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.\\n\\nThe New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital\\nrequirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage\\n(CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are\\nSimple VaR if the collateral is eligible.

    "#### Evaluation Metrics for NER\n",
    "Now that we can predict entities using our trained model, we can compare our predictions with the original annotations in our training data to evaluate how well our model performs for our task. The original annotations have been annotated manually by human annotators, and represent a \"Gold Standard\" against which we can compare our predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For most classification tasks, the most common evaluation metrics are:\n",
    "* accuracy\n",
    "* precision\n",
    "* recall\n",
    "* f1 score\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand these metrics, we need to understand the following concepts:\n",
    "* True positives - How many of the predicted entities are \"true\" according to the Gold Standard? (training annotation) \n",
    "* True negatives - How many entities did the model not predict which are actually not entities according to the Gold Standard?\n",
    "* False positives - How many entities did the model predict which are NOT entities according to the Gold Standard?  \n",
    "* False negatives - How many entities did the model \"miss\" - e.g. did not recognize as entities which are entities according to the Gold Standard? \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go on, it is important that you understand true/false positives/negatives as well as the evaluation metrics above. Take some time now to research the web in order to find answers to the following questions:\n",

    "##### Question: How are the evaluation metrics above defined in the context of evaluating Machine Learning models? How do they relate to True/False Positives/Negatives above? Please provide an intuitive description as well as the mathmatical formula for each metric. \n",
    "To get a good intuition for the evaluation metrics above it is important to get a good understanding of the confusion matrix.\n",
    "Because based on the confusion matrix we can derive all the mentioned metrics above, of course in the context of ML models.\n",
    "The definition of the confusion matrix is as follows: The columns represent the hypothesis or the prediction made of our model, \n",
    "whereas the the rows are the true labeld values the references in that case.\n",

    "##### Calculating Metrics based on token-level annotations or full entity-level. \n",

    "Token level evaluation evaluates how accurately did the model tag *each individual word/token* in the input. In order to understand this, we need to understand something called the \"BILUO\" Scheme (or BILOU or BIO). The spacy docs have a good reference. Please read and familiarize yourself with BILUO. \n",

We would like to be able to evaluate our models on a token-level using BILUO - so we need to convert our data to BILUO. Fortunately, Spacy provides a helper method to do this for us.\n",

    "##### Question: how does the model perform on token-level accuracy? What did it miss? In those cases where the predictions didn't match the gold standard, were the predictions plausible or just \"spurious\" (wrong)? \n",
    "Based on the accuracy result of the total accuracy above, it performs relatively good. In the most misclassified cases it misses skills-tokens, so it predicts them as non-entity-token. It also has problems to handle punctuations. In some cases it predicts punctuations as some kind of entities or labels them as non entity token, which is fine but based on the golden standard some or maybe all punctuations are not considered at all and set to '-', which leads to misclassification even our model predicted it as a non entity token. However punctuations shouldn't be considered as tokens or words at all, they should be ignored in that case from our model, which NER seemingly doesn't fulfill. There is also a smaller amount of misclassifications, where the prediction and the golden standard aren't spurious wrong. For example, our model has predicted a token not as the first token of a multi-token entity, but as a single-token entity and there are of course to be considered also other possible combinations. This last kind of misclassification leads back to the fact that in the misclassification case some tokens are not considered as any kind of entity token. "

    "##### Question: What might the advantages and disadvantages be of calculating accuracy on token-level? Hint: think about a document with 1000 tokens where only 10 tokens are annotated as entities. What might the accuracy be on such a document?  \n",
    "It is more a utility question. I mean it is a bit similar to the \"ham or spam\" problem. In our case the accuracy based in token-level might always have an high value but this automatically doesn't mean that our model is very good in extracting the right entities out of a given text. In the most cases we are dealing with a higher number of non entity token in a text. In that case our _TN_ value probably will always dominate the accuracy value, where as the other values as _TP_, _FP_ and _FN_ will not play an important role. So summerized, if someone isn't really interested in how good the trained model does extract the chosen entities from a given unseen text than the accuracy should be sufficient. For a better and more detailed evaluation of our model there must be also considered the other evaluation metrices as _Precision_, _Recall_, and _F1-score_."
